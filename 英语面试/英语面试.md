## 专业知识

####  英文介绍归并排序

MergeSort is an algorithm widely used in sorting, it is a typical application of Divide and Conquer. It is an effective algorithm with a nlgn time complexity and it is stable but not in place(就地).  The basic step of the algorithm is to merge the ordered subsequences into a complete ordered sequence.If two ordered subsequences are merged into one, it is called two-way merge.

#### 英文介绍快速排序

QuickSort is an algorithm widely used in sorting, it is a typical application of Divide and Conquer. It is an effective algorithm with a nlgn time complexity and it is  in place(就地) but not stable. The basic step of the algorithm is to select a 'pivot' element from the sequences and  partition the other elements into two sub-sequences, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot,and the pivot is placed in the right order. the sub-sequences are then sorted respectively in the same way. This can be done [in-place](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), requiring small additional amounts of [memory](https://link.zhihu.com/?target=https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory) to perform the sorting.

#### 英文介绍堆排序

HeapSort is  an algorithm widely used in sorting, it is a typical application of greedy strategy. It is an effective algorithm with a nlgn time complexity and it is  not in place(就地) and stable. The basic step of this algorithm is to divide the input data into a binary heap, which is a complete binary tree structure,and  repeatedly remove the largest element from the heap (the root of the heap), and insert it into the sorted sequences. The heap is updated after each removal to maintain the heap property. Once all objects have been removed from the heap, the result is a sorted sequences.

#### 插入排序

Insertion Sort is  an algorithm widely used in sorting,It is an algorithm with a square of n time complexity and it is  stable. the basic step of this algorithm is to divide the array  into a sorted and an unsorted part. then iterate through the unsorted part, taking one element at a time and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part. This process is repeated until all elements are placed in the right order. 

#### 希尔排序

Shell Sort is an algorithm widely used in sorting, an extension of the Insertion Sort.  the basic step of this algorithm is to divide the array into smaller subarrays and sorts these subarrays using Insertion Sort. and then sort the whole array using insertion sort.



The key difference is that Shell Sort first sorts elements that are far apart and progressively reduces the gap between elements being compared. This approach helps to partially sort the list quickly, leading to a faster final sorting process. 		

#### 折半插入排序

binary insertion Sort is  an algorithm widely used in sorting, an extension of the Insertion Sort.  the basic step of this algorithm is to take an element from the unsorted part  and find its correct position within the  sorted part using a binary search. This process is repeated until all elements are placed in the right order.This reduces the number of comparisons needed to place the element in its proper place, making the sorting process more efficient compared to the standard Insertion Sort. 

#### 冒泡排序

BubbleSort is  an algorithm widely used in sorting,It is an algorithm with a square of n time complexity and it is  stable. The basic  step of this algorithm is to compare adjacent items, and swap them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. 

#### 选择排序

Selection Sort is  an algorithm widely used in sorting,It is an algorithm with a square of n time complexity and it is not  stable.  the basic step of this algorithm is to divide the array  into a sorted and an unsorted part. then repeatedly select the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part  and moves it to the beginning (or end) of the sorted part. 

#### DFS

DFS  stands for Depth-First Search, it is  an algorithm widely used in  graph traversaling. The basic step of this algorithm is to start at a chosen node, explores its adjacent nodes, and continues deeper until it reaches a leaf node. It then backtracks and explores other branches. DFS  is widly applied in various  aspects,such as  pathfinding and searching in graphs.

#### BFS

BFS stands for Breadth-First Search,it  is  an algorithm widely used in graph traversaling. The basic step of this algorithm is to start at a chosen node, explores its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on.
